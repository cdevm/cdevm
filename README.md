## Just the beginning... 
Early in 2024, I first discovered my passion and love for coding. So I'm still very new and at the beginning of this wonderful journey. I'm learning almost every day, taking on new concepts, learning new skills and challenging the knowledge and skills already acquired. 

Happy to connect and collaborate on projects!
